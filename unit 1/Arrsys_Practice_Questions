1. Given an array, write functions to find the minimum and maximum elements in it. Try to do this operation in O(N) time complexity.
2. Write a program to reverse the given array. Try to do this using in-place reversal (without using extra space ie., space complexity should be O(1)).
3. Write a program to find the kth largest and kth smallest number in the given array. 
4. Write a program to count the number of occurrences (or frequencies) of a given element in an array.
